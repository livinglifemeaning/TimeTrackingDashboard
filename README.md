### Notes
- Estimated Time: 3hrs | Actual Time: idk 
- Spent forever trying to figure out how to use the params to conditionally extract information from the data within App.js bc useParams() only works within the components within <Route>. Ended up just creating seperate TimeCards component to render each TimeCard in there.
